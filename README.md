# How Wordle Works
For the official explanation of the game, please visit https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html. 

In short, in every game of Wordle, there is an unknown 5-letter word which the player is required to guess within 6 guesses. If the player's 6th guess is still incorrect, then the player is considered to have failed. 

<!-- The game begins with no hints whatsoever. After every guess, the player is shown the degree of correctness of each letter in their guess. If a letter of the guess is in the correct position, that letter is shown as green ('2'). If a letter of the guess is in the answer, but in the incorrect position, then that letter is shown as yellow ('1'). If a letter of the guess is not in the answer at all, then that letter is shown as grey ('0').
